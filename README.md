# Gatsby Apollo WPGraphQL JWT Starter

This aims to serve as a good starting point, to handle user registration and login with Apollo, WPGraphQL and WPGraphQL JWT Authentication.

We gonna use the following libraries:

- [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) - [Docs](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/)
- [WPGraphQL JWT Authentication](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication) - [Docs](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/extensions/wpgraphql-jwt-authentication/)
- [Apollo Client 3](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/master) - [Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta)


## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install modules**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    yarn
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    yarn run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
